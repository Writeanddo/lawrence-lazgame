Say health potion or something to eat
Make it more apparent what client wants
Don't come as often, when player doesn't have anything to give
Increase chances of certain clients at right scenario
Light candle with glowing orb
[DONE] Scare away bandit with spider
It's more interesting to have items and sell them, than to say I don't have anything and wait (obvious, but not)
1 click should buy and drag item at once.
Hide dragon head from lizard.
Thief should be more clear on what he wants and what will happen
There should be a better indication when you buy something and dont have gold
Pigeon should express it better that he will stop the thief
People like getting gifts (maybe make it a birthday)
Giving an item should automatically proceed with conversation
Make an achievement for making chicken happy (give crown)



EREBUS:
Dont let items fall
Rough movement
make it possible to choose what to buy instead of random 
it's not apparent what cat wants
avoid failure state, where you can just drop everything\
multiple uses for items, avoid cat etc
sale area, avoid dropping items
negotiate prices!

------------
Actual written quests, you need to manioulate items to progress
It requires connections or gold to get things done

COding stuff:
[DONE] - Implement conversation as coroutine state machine
[NOPE, IEnumerator cannot out variables] - Method to get response is out bool, out Item.
[] - Decide what to do and call appropriate coroutine.


disable item collider when dragging, enable immediately when released.
"Breathing" animation should shrink horizontally when sctrecthing vertically.
[DONE] Remake all client logic cleanly, like with the Blacksmith.

People seem to enjoy selling stuff to whitey. More characters should appreciate the player.
client idea: goat magician who buys mana potions and strange items and offers some magic 
that can backfire or make you rich (give rare strange items).

Cow shouldn't offer staff twice when you don't have the gold.
Right after you buy metal cow probably shouldn't come again as long as you don't have 
money for staff.

50 characters, each with its "ending" and an achievement.
Bandit shouldn't show up for some turn when you support royal guards.
[DONE]And royal guards should react differently seconds time they come for help, to indicate
[DONE]that there was progress and items weren't wasted.

Someone asks to repair items, you take it, someone else offers to fix it.

make some items have effects, like coffe, and you could by them and maybe combine them.

[DONE] fox
* wolf

* boar
* giraffe
* tiger

Maybe vampire saga should be a bigger story with more characters, where all are 
bats and turn into vampires upon arriving?

Some items are illegal and you'll be fined if guard sees you displaying them
But some other characters are interested in illegal items and pay good money!

Some sounds should be comming from the outside. Maybe when you help royal guards
and thief comes, he should hear guards nearby and try to run away without takink anything?


ALchemy guy should give spider or other useless stuff, that are useful in a very specific
scenario.


Add an egg, that hatches into something.

Feedback: The only criticisms I have are that it was a bit slow to get started (you have to interact with 4 or 5 customers before things start happening) and if you drop an item in front of the counter, you can’t seem to get it back, which sucked.

Lizward should give more different items than just the orb.

Goat should allow for more items to buy at once
lizward should ask for epic weapons,not items

As time goes on, walking speed should increase.
